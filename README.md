# 🖌️ Real-Time Hand Drawing in Video

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a system that allows users to draw or sketch directly on a video feed using their hands as the "pen." The goal is to detect hand movements in real-time, track them, and overlay a digital "stroke" wherever the hand moves. This can be used for:
- Interactive whiteboards
- Virtual art tools
- Educational applications
- Gesture-based interfaces

The system leverages **computer vision techniques**, such as **hand detection**, **tracking**, and **real-time rendering**, to achieve this functionality.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Hand Detection**: Identify and track the user's hand in real-time video.
2. **Stroke Generation**: Simulate drawing by capturing hand movement paths.
3. **Real-Time Rendering**: Overlay the drawn strokes onto the live video feed.
4. **Customization**: Allow users to adjust stroke thickness, color, and style.
5. **Export Capabilities**: Save the final drawing as an image or video.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV**: For video processing, hand detection, and tracking
- **MediaPipe Hands**: For accurate hand pose estimation
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib / Pygame**: For visualization (optional)
- **Flask / FastAPI**: For building web-based interfaces (if needed)

## 🔬 Methodology

### Step 1: Hand Detection

Use **MediaPipe Hands** to detect and track the user's hand in real-time:

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp

mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
hands = mp_hands.Hands(static_image_mode=False, max_num_hands=1, min_detection_confidence=0.7)

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Use webcam

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Convert BGR to RGB for MediaPipe
    rgb_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    
    # Process the frame
    results = hands.process(rgb_frame)
    
    if results.multi_hand_landmarks:
        for hand_landmarks in results.multi_hand_landmarks:
            # Draw landmarks on the frame
            mp.solutions.drawing_utils.draw_landmarks(
                frame,
                hand_landmarks,
                mp.solutions.hands.HAND_CONNECTIONS
            )
    
    cv2.imshow('Hand Detection', frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Step 2: Stroke Generation

Track the hand's position over time and simulate a "stroke" by connecting consecutive points:

```python
import numpy as np

def draw_stroke(frame, previous_point, current_point, thickness=5, color=(255, 0, 0)):
    cv2.line(frame, previous_point, current_point, color, thickness)
```

### Step 3: Real-Time Rendering

Overlay the drawn strokes onto the live video feed:

```python
drawn_points = []

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Detect hand
    results = hands.process(cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    
    if results.multi_hand_landmarks:
        for hand_landmarks in results.multi_hand_landmarks:
            # Get the tip of the index finger (landmark 8)
            x, y = int(hand_landmarks.landmark[8].x * frame.shape[1]), int(hand_landmarks.landmark[8].y * frame.shape[0])
            
            # Add point to the list
            drawn_points.append((x, y))
            
            # Draw all points
            for i in range(1, len(drawn_points)):
                cv2.line(frame, drawn_points[i - 1], drawn_points[i], (255, 0, 0), 5)
    
    cv2.imshow('Real-Time Drawing', frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Step 4: Customization

Allow users to customize:
- Stroke thickness
- Color
- Background video
- Export options (save as image/video)

### Step 5: Exporting the Drawing

Save the final drawing as an image or video:

```python
# Save as image
cv2.imwrite('output_drawings/drawing.png', frame)

# Save as video
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output_drawings/drawing.mp4', cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'), 30, (frame_width, frame_height))
out.write(frame)
out.release()
```

## 🚀 Future Work

1. **Background Removal**: Use segmentation models like **YOLOv8-seg** or **SAM** to remove the background and focus only on the drawing.
2. **Multi-User Support**: Extend the system to allow multiple users to draw simultaneously.
3. **Gesture Controls**: Add gestures for actions like erasing, changing colors, or saving.
4. **Integration with Whiteboards**: Deploy as a plugin for virtual whiteboard platforms.
5. **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Combine with AR frameworks for immersive drawing experiences.
